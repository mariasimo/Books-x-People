# Books x People

Books x People is a little app where users can **add their book recomendations so others can read and discover** new things, specially during COVID-19 quarantine.

It's quite simple, really. It has an add book and a search book by tags functionality. It also has a detail view for each book, while the main booklist view looks like a bookshelf.

Initially, this was a code-along of [this GraphQL + React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iK6Qhn-QLcXCXPQUov1U7f) from @iamshaunjp. So thanks for the inspiration!



📁 

#### Download the project 

```
git clone https://github.com/mariasimo/Books-x-People
```



⚙️ 

#### Config the project

Project is divided in two main folders. Client and Server.

In order to start the project, you have to create a .env file at the server folder and write in it:

```
PORT=4000
DBSTR=<string-to-cloud-db-here>
DBLOCAL=<string-to-local-db-here>
MAILUSER='<mail-password-for-nodemailer-transport>
MAILPASS=<mail-password-for-nodemailer-transport>
```

**Note that you will need your own mail transport account in order to receive mails with the book submitted and moderate them as admin.*



Then, go to **client** folder and create a .env.dev file:

```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
REACT_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```



🚀

#### Run the project

First, start the ***\*server\**** with one of these commands:

```node app.js
nodemon app.js
```



And then, start ***\*client\**** with command:

```
npm start
```

Ta-da! Go visit http://localhost:3000
